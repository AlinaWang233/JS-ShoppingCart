# JS-ShoppingCart

The code for HTML and CSS part of this project is made by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM) and I completed the JavaScript part of this project to implement the interactive features, such as buttons.

Set up stripe checkout function(Stripe Checkout API) for the shopping cart purchase button using npm, fs, Express.js and Node.js.

Plannning to implement newer version of Stripe Checkout in the future.
